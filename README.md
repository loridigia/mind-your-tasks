The project has beed developed as a university course on Human Computer Interaction.
The idea for the project started when in order to organize the work for the project (like documents, idea ecc.) we found ourself to share those files via some famouse social media. So we thought, why dont we develop a simple and intuitive app that allows the users to share tasks? 

Some use-cases:
* Organize a party (halloween, new year's eve, marriages)
* Organize a small size project (universitary / school project)


Since the pourpose of the course was to focus on the UX and UI, all the backend-related stuff is mocked, but could be easy implemented.
It's my first mobile app and my first time on Flutter, no particular patter has been followed and a you will find a lot of boilerplate code (due to short developing time), don't hate me for this :)
